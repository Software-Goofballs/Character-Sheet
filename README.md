## Special Abilities

<details>
<summary>

### Racial

</summary>

#### Darkvision (60 feet)
#### Fey Ancestry
You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

#### Trance
Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. 

#### Incisive Sense
You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Insight) checks.

#### Blessing of the Moon Weaver
You know the light cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the sleep spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the invisibility spell (targeting yourself only) once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Casting these spells with this trait doesn't require material components. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Background: Investigator
https://5e.tools/backgrounds.html#investigator_vrgr

</summary>

#### Official Inquiry
You're experienced at gaining access to people and places to get the information you need. Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, you can gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime you're investigating. Those who aren't involved in your investigation avoid impeding you or pass along your requests. Additionally, local law enforcement has firm opinions about you, viewing you as either a nuisance or one of their own.

### Class

</summary>

#### Bardic Inspiration (d6)
The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

#### Song of Rest
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra Hit Points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

#### Magical Inspiration (Optional)
At 2nd level, if a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.

#### Jack of All Trades
Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

## Backstory
Agustus was always a curious child....

He is functionally an investigative journalist.
Truth drives him more than anything else. And the truth must be shared. 
However, he does not do well with a "observe but do not interfere" mindset, so when he uncovers evil he works with XXXXXXXXXXXXX to root it out and tell the tale.
