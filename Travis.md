## Special Abilities
### Curses (2 per short rest)
#### Curse of the Marked
As a bonus action, you mark a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the end of your turn, whenever you hit the cursed creature with a weapon, you roll an additional 1d6 when determining the elemental damage.

***Amplify.*** The next attack roll you make against the target before the end of your turn has advantage.
#### Curse of Binding
As a bonus action, you attempt to bind a Large or smaller creature you can see within 30 feet of you, which must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the cursed creature’s speed is reduced to 0 and it can’t use reactions until the end of your next turn.

***Amplify.*** This curse lasts for 1 minute and can affect any creature regardless of size. The cursed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.
### Hunter's Brand (once per short rest)
Once per short rest, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can curse that creature with a brand. You always know the direction to the branded creature as long as it’s on the same plane as you. Further, each time the branded creature deals damage to you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you, the branded creature takes psychic damage equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1).

Your brand lasts until you dismiss it or until you use this feature to apply a brand to another creature. Your brand can be dispelled with Dispel Magic, and is treated as a level 4 spell.
### Lumininous Attacks
When you damage a creature with a weapon, that creature glows with faint light until the end of your next turn. For the duration, the creature gains no benefit from any cover or from being invisible.
### Nimble Escape
You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.
